      "question": "If two independent Poisson processes with rates λ₁ and λ₂ are merged, what is the rate of the resulting process?",

        "a": "λ₁ - λ₂",
        "b": "λ₁ × λ₂",
        "c": "λ₁ + λ₂",
        "d": "max(λ₁, λ₂)"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Subtraction is incorrect; this doesn't model merging.",
        "b": "Multiplying the rates is incorrect for Poisson merging.",
        "c": "Correct! The merged process has rate λ₁ + λ₂. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process#Operations_on_Poisson_processes'>Reference</a>",

      "question": "In a Poisson process with rate λ, if each event is independently classified as Type A with probability p and Type B with 1-p, what is the rate of the resulting Type A process?",

        "a": "This overestimates the intensity.",

      "question": "Why is a Poisson process suitable for modeling the emission of radioactive particles?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Emissions occur at fixed intervals",
        "b": "Emissions occur in bursts only",
        "c": "Emissions are independent and occur randomly over time",
        "d": "All particles are emitted at the same time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Fixed intervals contradict randomness of a Poisson process.",
        "b": "Poisson processes assume isolated, not bursty, events.",

Poisson processes are ideal for modeling random, independent emissions. <a href='https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Probability_Theory/Probability_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Stochastic_Processes_(Siegrist)/14%3A_The_Poisson_Process#:~:text=The%20Poisson%20process%20is%20one,in%20a%20piece%20of%20material.'>Example</a>",

      "question": "In the call center model, if calls arrive following a Poisson process with λ = 10 calls/hour, what is the expected number of calls in a 30-minute interval?",

        "d": "15"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, so expected calls = 10 * 0.5 = 5.",
        "b": "This is for a full hour, not half.",
        "c": "Overestimation, corresponds to 2 hours.",

      "question": "When splitting a Poisson process, the resulting processes are also Poisson. What property must the splitting mechanism satisfy for this to hold?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It must be memoryless",
        "b": "It must be deterministic",
        "c": "It must be independent and probabilistic for each event",
        "d": "It must depend on the time of arrival"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Memorylessness refers to the exponential distribution, not splitting.",
        "b": "Deterministic splitting wouldn't preserve Poisson properties.",
        "c": "Correct! Independent probabilistic splitting ensures each stream remains Poisson. <a href='https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter11/11_1_3_merging_and_splitting_poisson_processes.php'>Read here</a>",
