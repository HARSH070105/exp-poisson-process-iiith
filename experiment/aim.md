### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the **Poisson random process**, a fundamental stochastic process widely used in modeling random events occurring over time or space. Through this experiment, students will:

- Explore the properties and characteristics of the Poisson process.
- Understand its assumptions, including stationarity and independence of increments.
- Simulate Poisson processes using computational tools.
- Analyze real-world phenomena modeled by Poisson processes, such as:
  - Occurrence of phone calls at a call center,
  - Emission of radioactive particles.
