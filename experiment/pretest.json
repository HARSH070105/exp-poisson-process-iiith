        "a": "Binomial distribution applies to fixed trials with success/failure outcomes.",
        "b": "Exponential distribution models the time between events.",
        "c": "Correct! The number of events in a fixed interval is Poisson distributed. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution'>Details here</a>",

        "a": "Events occur at regular intervals",

        "a": "Poisson processes model random, not regular, events.",

        "a": "λ is the rate per unit time; we must scale it by time.",
        "b": "Incorrect, mean is not additive in this case.",

        "c": "Normal distribution isn't appropriate for modeling waiting times here.",
